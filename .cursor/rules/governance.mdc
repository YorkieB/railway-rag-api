# Governance Principles

## Mission Statement

Jarvis is a sovereign, multi-modal, agentic assistant that operates within your personal and work domains, grounded in your documents and tools, with zero vendor lock-in.

**Jarvis IS**:
- A reasoning engine (LLM-driven chat, code, analysis)
- A perception system (voice, screen share, video, camera)
- A task automation platform (browser control, OS control, API orchestration)
- A knowledge system (RAG over personal documents with uncertainty guardrails)
- Your computational extension, not a surveillance tool

**Jarvis is NOT**:
- A consumer app or SaaS product (single-tenant, self-hosted or enterprise)
- A real-time collaboration platform (e.g., Slack alternative)
- A replacement for specialized tools (e.g., Photoshop, CAD software)
- A guarantor of safety without human oversight on destructive actions
- A public chatbot; it is restricted to authenticated, authorized users
- Capable of acting without explicit user approval or triggering guardrails

## MVP vs V1 vs V2 Scope

### MVP (Weeks 1-8)
**Core Scope:**
- Chat (text input/output)
- RAG (PDF/DOCX upload)
- Basic conversation history
- Project separation
- Uncertainty protocol

**Out of MVP:**
- Live sessions
- Browser control
- OS control
- Export
- Memory
- Eval suite

**Success Criterion:** User can chat with Jarvis about their documents and get grounded answers without hallucinations.

### V1 (Weeks 9-20)
**Add:**
- Streaming voice (STT/TTS)
- Screen share assist
- Basic Playwright browser control
- Uncertainty + safety guardrails
- PDF export

**Out of V1:**
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Windows companion
- Advanced memory
- Eval suite

### V2 (Weeks 21+)
**Add:**
- Full Windows automation
- Multi-agent CrewAI pipelines
- Advanced memory (project + global)
- Complete eval pack (50-100 tests)
- Avatar presence

**Out of V2:**
- Real-time multimodal live sessions
- Complex agentic autonomy
- Advanced vision reasoning

## Zero Vendor Lock-in
- Use platform-agnostic solutions (ChromaDB, standard APIs)
- Avoid proprietary cloud services that create lock-in
- Prefer self-hosted or open-source alternatives

## Global Uncertainty Protocol
When Jarvis must say "Uncertain":
- **RAG retrieval fails**: No relevant chunks found, or score below threshold
- **Browser element not found**: Element not in AX Tree after Accessibility Tree check
- **Live session errors**: Audio/video transcription fails, network drops
- **OS action blocked**: Permission denied, app not found
- **Ambiguous user intent**: Multiple interpretations; ask for clarification instead of guessing

**Implementation**:
- Chat: "I'm not confident about [fact]. I'd need to [action] to verify."
- Browser: If element not in AX Tree → Uncertainty protocol instead of hallucinating selector
- RAG: If retrieval returns no chunks → Say so explicitly; don't fabricate
- Live: If audio glitches or video drops → Report failure, don't proceed

## Privacy & Retention Principles
- **Data Residency**: Text data (chat, RAG) stays on backend
- **Secrets**: API keys, passwords never leave local device
- **Live Sessions**: NOT stored by default; transcripts only (unless explicitly enabled)
- **Retention**: Chat messages 90 days (default), RAG documents indefinite (user controls), Live transcripts 30 days
- **Redaction**: Credit cards, SSNs, API keys, passwords redacted before logging

## Code Standards for Uncertainty

### RAG Responses
- **Implement uncertainty protocol** in RAG responses
- **Never guess** when retrieval is empty
- **Always cite sources** when available
- **Explicitly state** when information is not available
- Return structured uncertainty response: `{"uncertain": true, "message": "I don't have information about X. Would you like me to [search the web / ask you / check your documents again]?"}`

### Error Handling
- Always handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Surface uncertainty explicitly, don't hide failures
- Provide actionable alternatives when information is unavailable
